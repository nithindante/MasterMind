# MasterMind
A game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs). Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct and just the correct element but in the wrong space.

02 Februrary :  Create a ruby program that will play mastermind, here the user is person who is the codebreaker and the system is always the codemaker

03 February: Modified the code so that both user and computer can be code-breaker or code-maker and also modified the code so that, the computer choices will always remember the same position if it matches with user input
